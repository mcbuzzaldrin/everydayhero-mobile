Sup guys.

Some notes from the Scrum Master:
 * When making changes please create a branch.
 * When making major changes or fixes to a branch, create another branch.
 * Read: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
 * NEVER commit directly to master. Create a pull request for your branch.
 * We will review PRs during our meetings and merge as necessary.
 * We must communicate what parts of the code we are touching so we don't have a merging conflict from hell.
 * Good luck.
